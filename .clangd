  ClangTidy:
    # Add check groups relevant to memory safety and good practices.
    # '*' would enable all checks, but can be very noisy.
    # Consider starting with broad, useful categories.
    Add:
      - 'bugprone-*' # Catches common bug patterns, some memory related.
      - 'cppcoreguidelines-*' # Enforces C++ Core Guidelines, many of which relate to memory safety and resource management.
      - 'performance-*' # Some performance checks can also highlight inefficient memory use.
      - 'portability-*'
      - 'readability-*'
      # You could add more specific checks here if desired.

    # Remove any specific checks you find problematic or too noisy,
    # but be cautious when removing checks if the goal is maximal safety.
    # Remove:
    #   - 'some-check-you-dont-want'

    # Ensure all selected checks are run, even if they are slower.
    FastCheckFilter: None # Options: Strict (default), Loose, None [1][4]

    # You can also pass options to specific clang-tidy checks if needed.
    # CheckOptions:
    #   some-check.SomeOption: 'value'
