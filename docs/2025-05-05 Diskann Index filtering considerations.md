# I would need to also provide options for candidate rowids and limits eventually.  or a filter on similarity score no?  in addition, due to complex combined filters, the top k may have be more permissive when the results are fused.  what about all of these considerations?

Integrating a disk-based, graph-based ANN vector index into DuckDB while supporting advanced filtering and result manipulation involves several practical considerations, especially regarding interaction with the vectorized engine and handling complex query logic. Here's a breakdown based on your requirements and the search results:

1. **Providing Options for Limits (`top_k`)**:
    * **Implementation:** This is a standard feature for vector search. Your custom index scan operator within the DuckDB extension must accept `k` (the number of nearest neighbors requested) as a parameter.
    * **Interaction:** The operator performs the ANN graph traversal on disk, aiming to find the `k` ROWIDs corresponding to the vectors most similar to the query vector. It then outputs this list of ROWIDs, likely as a `Vector` within a `DataChunk`, to the next operator in the DuckDB query plan.
2. **Providing Options for Candidate ROWIDs (Pre-Filtering)**:
    * **Concept:** This involves narrowing the search space *before* the ANN search begins, often based on metadata filters[^3][^5][^7]. You essentially tell the index: "only search for neighbors among *these specific rows*".
    * **Implementation:**
        * The query would first use DuckDB's standard SQL engine to apply metadata filters (e.g., `WHERE product_category = 'electronics' AND price &lt; 100`).
        * This filtering stage produces a set of ROWIDs satisfying the metadata conditions.
        * Your custom ANN index scan operator needs to be designed to accept this *input set of candidate ROWIDs*.
    * **Interaction \& Challenges:**
        * Instead of searching the entire index structure, your operator now searches only within the subgraph or vectors corresponding to the provided ROWIDs.
        * **Crucial Problem:** Pre-filtering often invalidates the assumptions of standard ANN algorithms (like HNSW or DiskANN), which rely on the full graph structure for efficient traversal[^3][^7]. Applying the filter first might force your operator to perform a brute-force (exact k-NN) search *only on the filtered subset*, reading potentially many vector embeddings from disk. This can be slow if the filtered subset is large[^3][^7].
        * Some index types, like IVF, are inherently designed around searching only a subset of partitions (`probes`), making them more amenable to certain kinds of pre-filtering or candidate selection[^1][^6]. Your graph-based index would need a custom strategy to handle this efficiently on disk.
3. **Filtering on Similarity Score (Thresholding)**:
    * **Concept:** Instead of asking for the top `k` neighbors, you ask for all neighbors within a certain similarity score or distance threshold (e.g., `cosine_similarity &gt; 0.9` or `euclidean_distance &lt; 0.1`).
    * **Implementation:** Your ANN index scan operator can be modified. During graph traversal, instead of strictly keeping track of the top `k`, it can collect all nodes visited that satisfy the distance/similarity threshold.
    * **Interaction:** This might be applied *during* the ANN search (if the algorithm allows pruning based on distance) or *after* an initial candidate search. The operator outputs the ROWIDs of all vectors meeting the criteria. This fits naturally into the vectorized model, producing a potentially variable-sized vector of ROWIDs.
4. **Complex Combined Filters and Permissive `top_k` (Post-Filtering \& Fusion)**:
    * **Concept:** This is often necessary when you have both vector similarity requirements and complex metadata filters that are hard or inefficient to apply *before* the vector search[^3][^5][^7]. The strategy is:

5. Perform the ANN search with a larger, more "permissive" `k` (e.g., `k=100` instead of `k=10`). This increases the chance that vectors satisfying the *later* metadata filters are included in the initial candidate set[^7].
6. Retrieve these `k` candidate ROWIDs (and potentially their similarity scores) from your index scan operator.
7. Use DuckDB's standard vectorized engine to fetch the required metadata columns for these `k` candidates.
8. Apply the remaining complex metadata filters using standard SQL `WHERE` clauses on this candidate set.
9. Optionally re-rank or fuse results if combining scores (e.g., vector similarity + keyword relevance) using methods like Ranked Fusion or Relative Score Fusion[^4].
10. Apply the final, intended `LIMIT`.
    * **Implementation:** Your index scan operator primarily needs to support the larger `k`. The subsequent filtering and ranking happen via standard DuckDB operators acting on the `DataChunk` produced by your scan.
    * **Interaction:** This approach leverages the ANN index for its speed in finding *approximate* nearest neighbors from the full dataset and then uses the efficient vectorized engine for exact filtering on a smaller candidate set[^7]. The main risk is that the *true* best match satisfying all filters might fall outside the initial permissive `k` retrieved by the ANN search[^7].

**Summary for your Disk-Based Graph ANN Index Extension:**

* Your custom scan operator must handle parameters like `k` (limit) and potentially a similarity threshold.
* For pre-filtering (candidate ROWIDs), the operator needs to accept a list of ROWIDs to constrain its search, but be aware this likely degrades ANN performance, potentially forcing a brute-force scan over the subset's vectors read from disk.
* For post-filtering (complex filters, fusion), the primary requirement for your index scan is to efficiently support retrieving a larger initial candidate set (`k`) from the disk-based structure. The complex filtering logic itself will be handled by subsequent standard DuckDB operators processing the results in a vectorized manner.
* Disk I/O will be a major factor. Design decisions (like graph structure, node layout on disk, caching) should aim to minimize disk reads during traversal, especially considering potential brute-force requirements under pre-filtering scenarios.
