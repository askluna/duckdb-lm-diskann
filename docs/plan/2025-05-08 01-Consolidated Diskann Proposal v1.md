# LM-DiskANN Extension: Architecture and Design Evolution

## Background and Evolution from LM-DiskANN Paper to DuckDB Extension

**LM-DiskANN Overview:** *LM-DiskANN* (Low-Memory DiskANN) is a dynamic graph-based Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) index designed to reside primarily on disk while using minimal RAM. It builds on the DiskANN approach, which stores a navigable small-world graph of vectors for high recall and performance, but eliminates DiskANN’s need to keep a compressed copy of all vectors in memory. In LM-DiskANN, each graph node’s disk *block* contains *complete routing information* – the node’s vector and a list of neighbors (with compressed neighbor vectors) – enabling searches with only on-demand disk reads and negligible memory overhead. The original paper demonstrated that this design achieves recall-latency performance comparable to in-memory indexes while drastically reducing memory footprint.

**From Paper to DuckDB Integration:** The academic prototype of LM-DiskANN provided the core idea of disk-resident graph indexing with dynamic updates. However, integrating this into DuckDB as an index extension required significant architectural evolution. The extension must handle **transactional updates, concurrency, and recovery** in a DBMS context – areas beyond the paper’s scope. Initial integration attempts (using DuckDB’s in-memory allocators) revealed issues like **memory-pinning and poor eviction**, prompting a redesign to a *“shadow table” architecture* that fully embraces disk storage and DuckDB’s WAL/transaction mechanisms. Over successive design iterations (v1 and v2), the architecture evolved to ensure **ACID properties**, minimal write amplification, and synergy with DuckDB’s optimizer for filtered queries. The final design, described below, marries the LM-DiskANN graph structure with DuckDB’s MVCC model and storage framework, resulting in a robust, modular extension that supports billion-scale vector data with dynamic inserts/deletes.

## Architectural Overview

**Index-as-Folder Design:** Each LM-DiskANN index is self-contained in its own directory on disk, isolating its files from the main database. This directory contains two primary components:

- **Primary Graph File (`graph.lmd`):** An append-only binary file storing the ANN graph’s nodes in fixed-size *NodeBlock* units (e.g. 8 KB per node). Each NodeBlock holds one vector and its adjacency list (neighbors), as detailed below. This is the main index data on disk.
- **Index Store Database (`diskann_store.duckdb`):** A DuckDB *secondary database* (with its own WAL) that maintains all auxiliary metadata for the index. Using a DuckDB database file leverages robust recovery and transactional integrity for index metadata. Key tables in this store include:
  - **Shadow Delta Table (`__lmd_blocks`):** A WAL-backed table recording new or modified NodeBlocks (as whole blobs) that have not yet been merged into the main graph file. This serves as a durable delta “journal” of pending updates.
  - **RowID↔NodeID Mapping Table (`lmd_lookup`):** Maps each DuckDB base table **row_id** to its corresponding **node_id** in the ANN graph. This indirection allows translating search results back to user tuples and permits row-id reuse handling.
  - **Index Metadata Table (`index_metadata`):** Stores global metadata (vector dimension, graph parameters like max degree `R`, current node count, next node ID, etc.) and dynamic state (e.g. a merge sequence number, free list head for reclaimed blocks). Keeping this in a table ensures atomic updates and easy verification.
  - **Tombstone Table (`tombstoned_nodes`):** Tracks *logically deleted* nodes. Each entry is a node_id and a deletion epoch, indicating the node has been removed and should be ignored by searches (and eventually reclaimed).

**Isolation and Maintainability:** By confining index data to a dedicated folder, the extension keeps failures localized. A crash or corruption in the index files does not affect the main DuckDB database. Backup and restore of an index is as simple as copying its folder, and dropping the index means deleting that folder. The main DuckDB database stores only a reference to the index location and perhaps minimal info (like the index name and config in the catalog), keeping the index largely decoupled.

**High-Level Operation:** When the index is in use, queries first consult in-memory caches, then the `diskann_store.duckdb` tables, and finally `graph.lmd` on SSD, to retrieve NodeBlocks. Updates (inserts or deletes) are applied by writing new NodeBlocks to the shadow table (`__lmd_blocks`) within the store DB, under transaction protection. A background process later *merges* these changes into `graph.lmd` in bulk. This design provides **transactional semantics** (via the store DB’s WAL and DuckDB’s transactions) and **high I/O performance** by batching writes.

## Node Block Layout and Graph Structure

Each vector in the index corresponds to a **NodeBlock** in the `graph.lmd` file. All NodeBlocks are equal-sized (e.g. 8192 bytes) and aligned, so the `node_id` serves as an index for direct file offset (`offset = node_id * BLOCK_SIZE`). This fixed size simplifies random access and in-place updates.

**Contents of a NodeBlock:** Each block is essentially a self-contained representation of a graph node and its neighbors. The layout is:

- **Node Header:** Includes administrative fields:
  - `node_id` (uint32/64) – Unique identifier for the node (also determines its block position). Assigned once and never reused.
  - `row_id` (int64) – The DuckDB row identifier of the tuple this vector came from. This is stored for verification or recovery (and to rebuild `lmd_lookup` if needed).
  - `origin_txn_id` (int64) – The DuckDB transaction ID that created or last modified this node block.
  - `commit_epoch` (int64) – A monotonically increasing commit timestamp or epoch given when the creating transaction committed. Used for MVCC visibility checks.
  - `node_version` (int64) – A local version counter incremented on each update to this block (neighbors or vector). Helps resolve concurrent write conflicts by choosing the highest version.
  - `tombstone` (boolean) – A flag indicating the node is logically deleted. Set to true when a deletion is committed; causes searches to ignore this node.
  - `checksum` (uint64) – Checksum (e.g. xxHash64) of the block’s content for corruption detection.
- **Vector Data:** The full uncompressed feature vector for this node (e.g., an array of `float` values of length = dimension). This is used for accurate distance calculations when needed (e.g., final re-ranking).
- **Neighbor List:** An array of neighbor **node_ids** (e.g., up to `R` neighbors, where `R` is the max degree). These are the outgoing edges in the graph from this node. Neighbors are typically chosen based on nearest-neighbor criteria (the graph is often built using something like the Vamana or NSW algorithm).
- **Compressed Neighbor Vectors:** For each neighbor in the list, a compressed representation of that neighbor’s vector is stored. Commonly product quantization or tertiary quantization is used to shrink vectors (e.g., 16× smaller) while preserving distance approximations. Storing these in the NodeBlock allows distance computations to neighbors without loading each neighbor’s full NodeBlock from disk – only the current block is needed.
- **Padding/Free Space:** Bytes padding the structure to the fixed block size. This can accommodate slight growth in neighbor list size without relocating the block. Large changes or overflows are handled by writing a new version of the block to the shadow store (copy-on-write).

*Figure: Conceptual NodeBlock Layout — ID & metadata, full vector, neighbor IDs, neighbor compressed vectors, then padding.* Each block has all info to evaluate that node and traverse to neighbors, enabling a **single disk I/O per node** during search. This trades extra storage for far fewer random reads: the search algorithm can fetch a node’s block and immediately have approximate distances to all its neighbors, rather than retrieving each neighbor separately.

**Graph Structure:** The nodes form a **navigable small-world graph** (like DiskANN’s graph or an HNSW graph). Each node links to ~`R` nearest neighbors, forming a highly connected graph that a greedy search can traverse to find close vectors. One node is designated as an entry point (often the one with maximum vector norm, as in DiskANN). The graph can be viewed as dynamic: insertions add a new node that connects to some existing nodes (and may cause some local neighbor list adjustments), while deletions remove a node (and ideally its references in others’ neighbor lists). The graph is kept *approximately* well-connected through local heuristics (e.g., neighbors are selected by a *prune* algorithm to maintain good recall). Periodic maintenance or smarter insertion heuristics can mitigate any degradation in graph quality over many updates.

**Identifier Management:** Node IDs are 64-bit and monotonically increasing as new nodes are added (the index can scale to billions of vectors). A crucial design decision is **not reusing node_ids of deleted nodes**, to avoid complex pointer updates in neighbors. Instead, deletions mark the ID as tombstoned. This means the `graph.lmd` file can have “holes,” which are handled by a free list (see below). References remain valid (they either point to an active node or a tombstone), simplifying neighbor list consistency. The 32-bit neighbor ID space (for up to ~4 billion nodes) remains sufficient under this approach.

## Storage Strategy: Shadow Tables, Delta Merges, and Free List Management

To handle dynamic updates efficiently, the extension uses a **Shadow Delta + Merge** strategy (a form of log-structured approach). Rather than modifying the `graph.lmd` file in place for each insert or delete (which would involve random writes and costly file rewriting), all updates go to the shadow delta table first, and a background process later *merges* them into the graph file in batches. This provides **low write amplification** and integrates with DuckDB transactions.

**Shadow Delta Table (`__lmd_blocks`):** This table (in `diskann_store.duckdb`) stores new or updated NodeBlocks as opaque blobs, one row per block, keyed by `block_id` (node_id). Schema example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE __lmd_blocks (
    block_id   BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,  -- node id (unique)
    data       BLOB NOT NULL,       -- serialized NodeBlock (fixed size)
    version    BIGINT NOT NULL,     -- node_version of this block
    commit_epoch BIGINT NOT NULL,   -- commit timestamp of this version
    tombstone  BOOLEAN NOT NULL,    -- deletion flag
    checksum   BIGINT NOT NULL      -- integrity checksum
) WITHOUT ROWID;
```

Entries in `__lmd_blocks` represent the **latest version** of a NodeBlock that hasn’t been merged to the main file yet. If a node is updated multiple times before merge, its row is updated (the table is essentially an upsert journal). DuckDB’s WAL will log these insertions, so upon commit, the update is safely on disk. Readers will check this table to get the newest block data if available, falling back to `graph.lmd` if not. The presence of a block in the shadow table effectively “overrides” the old on-disk version.

**RowID ↔ NodeID Mapping (`lmd_lookup`):** This is a simple two-column table mapping base table `row_id` (DuckDB’s internal row identifier for a tuple) to the index `node_id`. Whenever a vector is inserted into the base table and indexed, a new node_id is allocated and inserted here within the same transaction. On deletion, the mapping is removed. This mapping table is maintained transactionally (using DuckDB’s standard mechanisms) so that it’s always consistent with the base table state. A secondary index on `node_id` allows reverse lookups (useful for deleting by node_id). Storing this in a DuckDB table leverages the DB’s crash recovery; even if the index graph is lost, one can rebuild mappings by scanning NodeBlocks (each block also stores its row_id for redundancy). The mapping solves the problem of DuckDB potentially reusing row_ids – if a row is deleted and later another is inserted, DuckDB might reuse the identifier, but our mapping and commit epochs ensure the old node won’t be returned.

**Index Metadata (`index_metadata`):** This table holds configuration (dimension, distance metric, block size, max degree, etc.) and dynamic counters: e.g., total node count, next node_id to use, free list head, merge sequence number, last committed epoch, etc. Because it’s updated under transactions, we avoid manual file header writes. For example, after a merge, the metadata’s node count and merge number are updated in the same commit that clears the delta table entries, ensuring consistency.

**Tombstoned Nodes (`tombstoned_nodes`):** When a vector is deleted, its `node_id` is recorded here with a `deletion_epoch`. This provides a reliable record of deletions that have occurred. It serves two purposes: (1) to inform searches to skip those nodes (especially if a search might encounter an old block from `graph.lmd` that didn’t yet have the tombstone flag set), and (2) to aid in space reclamation. During merge, any NodeBlock with a node_id in this table is essentially garbage: the merge can drop it (and add its slot to the free list). The `deletion_epoch` can track when the deletion committed, which could be used to implement retention or time-travel (not typically needed, but it’s there).

**Free List and Space Reuse:** Deleted nodes leave vacant block slots in `graph.lmd`. We maintain a free list of such slots in `index_metadata` (e.g., as a linked list of free node_ids or a bitmask range). On merging, if a tombstoned node is encountered, its slot is added to the free list. Future merges can reuse these free slots for new NodeBlocks (instead of appending to the file). This keeps the file size in check and mitigates fragmentation. The strategy in the initial implementation is conservative: reuse free slots for new inserts, but *do not move existing blocks* to fill holes except possibly at the file tail. If the end of the file consists of free blocks, the file can be truncated (tail trimming) to reclaim space. Internal free space (holes in the middle) is reused for new writes but not compacted further to avoid expensive neighbor pointer updates (since node_ids would change if we re-numbered nodes). Over the long term, if the index accumulates many holes, an offline rebuild or defragmentation tool could be used – but under normal operation with merges, space is reused and the file remains mostly packed.

**Durability and Recovery:** All changes to these tables (`__lmd_blocks`, `lmd_lookup`, `index_metadata`, `tombstoned_nodes`) go through DuckDB’s WAL, so they follow the same durability guarantees as any DuckDB commit. A committing transaction that inserts a new vector will have not only the base table row but also the mapping and possibly a shadow NodeBlock insertion all in the WAL before commit is confirmed. If the system crashes, `diskann_store.duckdb` will replay its WAL and restore a consistent state (no lost committed updates, no half-applied changes). Meanwhile, the `graph.lmd` file is only written by the merge process, which is carefully designed to be crash-tolerant (discussed later). This two-tier design ensures that after crash recovery, the shadow table and metadata will reflect any updates that were committed but maybe not merged, so the system can either reapply them or treat them as the source of truth until the next merge.

## Transactional Consistency and MVCC Integration

A critical aspect of this extension is maintaining DuckDB’s transactional semantics (ACID properties). The index must respect *snapshot isolation* — queries should see the index state as of their transaction’s snapshot, and no phantom reads should occur even if vector data is added or removed concurrently. LM-DiskANN achieves this by embedding MVCC metadata in each NodeBlock and coordinating with DuckDB’s transaction manager.

**Commit Epochs and Visibility:** Each NodeBlock carries a `commit_epoch` indicating when it was made durable/visible. In DuckDB, transactions have a *snapshot timestamp/epoch*. When a query uses the index, it provides a snapshot epoch (usually the current committed epoch at transaction start). The index logic ensures that any NodeBlock with a commit_epoch greater than the query’s snapshot is treated as *not yet visible* (i.e., it’s from a later commit). Such blocks are ignored during search. For example, if Transaction A inserts a new vector (NodeBlock) and commits at epoch 100, and Transaction B (snapshot at 99) searches the index, B will see commit_epoch=100 on that node and skip it (it wasn’t there as of 99). This prevents “seeing the future.” Similarly, NodeBlocks from uncommitted transactions (which may have a provisional epoch or none) are invisible to all except the creating transaction.

**Origin Transaction ID and Abort Handling:** The `origin_txn_id` field in NodeBlocks is used to handle rollbacks. When a transaction inserts or updates nodes, those NodeBlocks are tagged with that txn ID. The flush/merge logic will verify the transaction’s fate via DuckDB’s transaction manager before making the update permanent. If the transaction aborted, those NodeBlocks are never written to `__lmd_blocks` (or if tentatively written, they’ll be discarded). Consequently, no “ghost” NodeBlock from a failed transaction ever pollutes the index. During recovery or startup, if we find a mapping in `lmd_lookup` but the corresponding NodeBlock is missing (which could happen if a crash occurred after writing the mapping but before flushing the NodeBlock), we detect the inconsistency and resolve it. The design suggests on startup to **reconcile mapping and data**: for each mapping, ensure a NodeBlock exists either in `graph.lmd` or `__lmd_blocks`; if not, the mapping is removed as an incomplete insertion. This self-healing ensures base table and index don’t disagree.

**Tombstones and Snapshot Isolation:** When deleting, marking a node as tombstoned is also done transactionally. The deletion’s commit_epoch serves to cutoff visibility. If a transaction with snapshot < deletion_epoch searches, it will still consider that node (meaning it existed at that snapshot). If snapshot ≥ deletion_epoch, the node is skipped (deleted by then). However, because neighbor references are updated eagerly on delete, it’s unlikely a search would even encounter a tombstoned node unless it’s using an outdated snapshot. The tombstone table and flags provide a safety net: if a search on an older snapshot does encounter a node that was later deleted, the `tombstone` flag in the block or an entry in `tombstoned_nodes` can tell the search logic to treat it as valid for that snapshot or skip as needed. Generally, we ensure that once a deletion is committed, any new searches (with newer snapshots) will not return that node at all.

**Maintaining RowID Consistency:** DuckDB’s `row_t` (row identifiers) can be reused after a commit+vacuum cycle. Our design defends against this by tying the mapping lifespan to the transaction. If a transaction inserts a row and indexes it, and later aborts, the mapping and NodeBlock are removed or never committed, so that row_id can be safely reused in the future with no collision in `lmd_lookup`. If a row is deleted and DuckDB reuses its `row_id` for a new row, the old node is already tombstoned (invisible to new snapshots), and a new NodeBlock with a fresh node_id will be created for the new data. There’s no reuse of node_id, and the mapping table will map the reused row_id to the new node_id. Meanwhile, the old tombstoned node cannot appear in results for the new row because it’s filtered out by epoch checks. This ensures **no stale or wrong vectors are returned** even if underlying row identifiers recycle.

**Consistency across Components:** We maintain a concept of an *index-wide epoch or version*. The `index_metadata` can include a global “last merge epoch” or “index version.” Whenever a merge happens or significant changes commit, this can increment. On index load (attach at database startup), we compare the stored `merge_sequence_number` in `index_metadata` with what DuckDB’s catalog last knew. If there’s a mismatch (perhaps indicating the index files were not fully checkpointed or were restored from backup), the extension can decide to invalidate or refresh the index. In extreme cases (detected corruption or mismatch), the extension will mark the index unusable and fall back to a full rebuild from the base table to avoid serving inconsistent results. These measures ensure that after any crash or restart, the index either comes up consistent with the database or not at all (never silently wrong).

## In-Memory Caching and Write-Back Buffering

Though the index is disk-based, effective use of memory for caching is important for performance. The extension employs a two-level caching strategy and an asynchronous write buffer:

- **LRU Node Cache:** An in-process Least-Recently-Used cache holds a limited number of NodeBlocks in deserialized form (objects in memory). The cache key is the `node_id` and the value is the NodeBlock structure (including vector and neighbors). This avoids repeated disk reads for “hot” nodes that are accessed frequently. The cache size is configurable (e.g., enough to hold the hottest few percent of nodes, or a certain MB limit). It uses an LRU eviction policy: when full, least-used entries are evicted *if they are clean*. **Dirty** NodeBlocks (those modified by an ongoing transaction and not yet flushed) are never evicted until flushed to disk to avoid losing updates. The cache ensures that if a query jumps around the graph (typical in ANN search), recently visited nodes remain in memory for quick reuse.
- **OS Page Cache / Buffer Manager:** For NodeBlocks not in the LRU cache, reads fall back to disk. The `graph.lmd` file is accessed via DuckDB’s `FileSystem` API or potentially memory-mapped. In either case, the operating system’s page cache will naturally buffer disk pages. Sequential reads during a merge or scan can warm the OS cache for subsequent random reads. We opted not to exclusively rely on DuckDB’s `BufferManager` for caching index pages, because earlier experiments showed that using DuckDB’s general-purpose buffer pool with a custom FixedSizeAllocator kept blocks pinned in memory, preventing proper eviction. Instead, by doing our own file I/O for the index, we let the OS manage caching and we retain fine-grained control via the LRU at the NodeBlock level. This approach ensures **bounded memory usage**: we do not pin the entire index in RAM, only a cache that can be tuned.
- **Dirty Ring Buffer:** For writes, the extension decouples the foreground transaction from the disk write cost using an in-memory ring buffer (circular queue) of dirty blocks. When a transaction modifies NodeBlocks (inserts a new node or updates neighbors), it *enqueues* those blocks (or references to them) into this buffer. A background thread (the flush daemon) consumes the queue, writing those blocks to the `__lmd_blocks` table asynchronously. The ring buffer is lock-free or uses minimal locking, allowing multiple producers (concurrent transactions) to add dirty entries without contention. Each buffer entry contains the block_id, a pointer to the NodeBlock data in memory, and possibly its computed checksum and a pointer for writing back the assigned commit epoch. This design absorbs bursts of updates and writes them out in batches, smoothing I/O and allowing the transaction commit to finish quickly (it mostly just adds to the queue and updates the mapping/metadata, which are lightweight).
- **Flush Daemon:** A dedicated background thread (or a scheduled task) continually monitors the dirty buffer. Upon transaction commits (or when the buffer is non-empty), it takes batches of dirty NodeBlocks and writes them to `__lmd_blocks`. The flush daemon prepares an `INSERT OR REPLACE` statement (with parameters for block_id, blob data, version, commit_epoch, tombstone, checksum) and executes it for each entry. To maintain ordering, if multiple versions of the same block are in the queue, only the latest is written (older ones can be skipped or overwritten in the table). The flush thread is carefully integrated with DuckDB’s transaction manager: it will **only flush blocks from committed transactions**. This can be done by checking each dirty entry’s `origin_txn_id` against the DB’s committed list or by the commit hook handing off only committed work. In practice, on each transaction commit that involves the index, we *signal the flush thread* (via a condition variable or similar) to wake and process that transaction’s dirty blocks immediately. This means by the time a COMMIT returns to the user, the new NodeBlocks are already either flushed or in the process of flushing to disk (within milliseconds), drastically narrowing any window of vulnerability. If a crash occurs right after commit, the WAL records in `diskann_store.duckdb` ensure that on recovery the blocks will appear in `__lmd_blocks` (or the commit will be rolled back entirely).

**Cache-Coherence with Writes:** When the flush thread writes a dirty block, it doesn’t remove it from the cache (the cache holds the latest copy). The cache entry is simply marked as clean once persisted. Readers always check the cache first, so they will get the latest data. If a NodeBlock is evicted while dirty (which we avoid), we would have to write it out first. Additionally, when a merge occurs and writes a block to `graph.lmd`, the cache can be updated or invalidated accordingly. The design uses either per-node locks or a global index write lock to ensure flush and merge don’t conflict (e.g., the merge thread might lock a block or the whole index while swapping in new data). In the steady state, the combination of LRU cache + shadow table read + base file read provides a **hierarchy of storage**: in-memory hot data, recent committed data in the DB, and bulk data on SSD.

**Memory Management:** The extension avoids uncontrolled memory growth. The cache is bounded and will free entries under pressure. The ring buffer has a fixed capacity; if it’s full (e.g., flush thread can’t keep up), insert transactions might block or slow until space frees – this is a backpressure mechanism to avoid unlimited memory use on massive ingest. By not using DuckDB’s internal buffer manager for NodeBlocks, we eliminate the risk of the index consuming the entire memory budget unchecked. Instead, we rely on our explicit structures and OS paging. This way, *even if the index holds billions of vectors*, one can configure it to use (for example) only 1 GB of RAM for caching, and the rest stays on disk. Other DuckDB operations (joins, sorts) still have their memory quota; the index’s memory use is distinct and controllable.

## Search Algorithm and Filtered Query Support

LM-DiskANN performs ANN search via a greedy graph traversal (like other small-world graph indexes). The search starts from an entry node and explores neighbors in order of increasing distance, using a max-heap or priority queue to keep track of candidates. The presence of all neighbor info in each NodeBlock is crucial: each time a node is visited, the algorithm can compute distances to all its neighbors *without additional I/O*, using the compressed neighbor vectors in that block, and decide which neighbors to visit next.

**Basic Search Procedure:** Given a query vector *q*, the search typically:

1. Loads the entry point NodeBlock (from cache, shadow, or disk).
2. Computes distances from *q* to all neighbors of that node (using either the neighbor’s compressed vectors for approximate distance or loading a neighbor’s full vector if needed for refinement).
3. Maintains two sets (heaps): one for *exploration* (candidates to visit) and one for the current *results*. Initially, the entry point is in both.
4. Iteratively, it pops the closest not-yet-visited candidate from the exploration heap, marks it visited, and inspects its neighbors (retrieving that neighbor’s NodeBlock). Each new neighbor not seen before is evaluated:
   - If the neighbor is “promising” (in terms of distance), it’s pushed to the exploration heap.
   - If we are doing a *K-NN search*, we also maintain a results set of the top K found so far.
5. The search ends when the exploration heap’s nearest candidate is not closer than the worst result in the top-K (for K-NN), or when a certain budget of nodes (`L_search`) has been examined.

This algorithm is essentially a *beam search* on the graph. The use of compressed vectors for distance calculations makes it approximate (final candidates can be re-scored with full vectors if needed).

**Skipping Invisible or Deleted Nodes:** The search logic interacts with MVCC by checking each NodeBlock’s metadata:

- If a neighbor NodeBlock’s `commit_epoch` is greater than the current transaction’s snapshot (or its `origin_txn_id` is uncommitted), that neighbor is treated as if it doesn’t exist (skip adding it to heaps).
- If a NodeBlock has `tombstone=true`, it represents a deleted node; the search will ignore it and not traverse further from it. In practice, we remove tombstoned nodes from neighbors lists at delete time, so search rarely even sees a tombstone block except possibly the entry point or if the deletion happened in between. Nonetheless, the check ensures no deleted vector is returned in results.

**Filtered Searches (Predicate Pushdown):** A powerful feature is the ability to perform *filtered* vector searches, e.g., “Find the nearest neighbors among vectors that satisfy some condition”. In a database context, this means there may be a secondary filter (like `WHERE category = 'Sports'`) on the same table. Rather than storing category labels in each NodeBlock (which would bloat the block and complicate maintenance), the design keeps the index content purely vectors and uses DuckDB to provide an **allowed IDs set** for filtering. There are two approaches:

- **Post-Filter:** Perform an unfiltered K-NN search in the index and then apply the WHERE filter to the resulting candidates. This is simple but might retrieve many candidates that get discarded, harming recall if filtered items are rare.
- **Pre-Filter (Allowed IDs):** Determine the set of row_ids (or node_ids) that satisfy the filter condition using the normal database indices or scans, then constrain the ANN search to only navigate through those allowed nodes.

The LM-DiskANN extension implements a pre-filter approach via an **`allowed_ids` set** provided at query time. DuckDB’s planner, when it knows an index scan is filtered by some other column(s), will produce a list or bitmap of qualifying row_ids from the base table. The index’s scan function then uses this as a mask: only node_ids present in `allowed_ids` are considered valid results. The challenge is that a strict filter can disconnect the graph (many neighbor links point to disallowed nodes). To handle this without losing recall, the search uses a **dual-heap strategy**:

- Maintain two priority queues: **Results Heap (RH)** for nodes that satisfy the filter, and **Exploration Heap (EH)** for all encountered nodes (regardless of filter).
- The search explores the graph using EH (so it can go through nodes that might not satisfy the filter, effectively tunneling through them), but only adds a node to RH if it is in `allowed_ids`.
- The termination condition is modified: the search continues until the best candidate in EH is worse (further in distance) than the worst node in RH’s top-K, *and* RH has gathered K results. This ensures that we haven’t missed a closer valid node that could only be reached via some invalid nodes.

This dual-heap algorithm prevents the search from getting stuck in a region of the graph where all neighbors happen to be filtered out. It will continue to explore through unqualified nodes as necessary to reach qualified ones. Only the RH (filtered results) will ultimately be returned.

**Passing the Allowed IDs:** The interface for providing `allowed_ids` from DuckDB to the index is designed for efficiency. DuckDB can supply it as a bitmask, a selection vector, or any compressed representation of the qualifying tuples. In the extension, we define an API such as `struct ScanOptions { SelectionVector *allowed_ids; idx_t count; /* etc */ }`. The index will likely convert this into a fast lookup structure, e.g., an array of booleans indexed by node_id or a hash set, depending on sparsity. Because the allowed set could be large (in worst case, no filtering, it includes all nodes), care is taken to optimize membership checks (bitset in CPU cache, etc.).

**Search Parameters:** The extension supports tuning of search parameters at runtime:

- `K` – number of neighbors to return.
- `L_search` (a.k.a. `ef` in HNSW terms) – the number of nodes to explore (controls recall vs. latency). This can be configured per query or globally, and potentially automatically increased for filtered queries.
- Distance metric – cosine or inner product (L2 could be supported but initial implementation focuses on cosine/IP, since L2 with certain compressions was problematic).
   If a filtered search ends and RH has fewer than K results (meaning not enough valid points were found within the explored area), the extension can issue a **warning** to the user (using DuckDB’s warning mechanism) suggesting to increase `L_search`. This helps users diagnose cases where the filter was very selective or the graph connectivity was insufficient.

**Distance Computation:** Distance calculations are vectorized and optimized. We implement cosine similarity and inner product distance functions using SIMD intrinsics over `std::span<float>` data. For compressed neighbor vectors, a custom distance approximation is used (e.g., if using ternary {−1,0,1} compression, distance reduces to a dot product on {−1,0,1} which is efficient). The extension only falls back to reading a neighbor’s full vector if absolutely necessary (perhaps for final reordering of the top results to improve accuracy, though often the approximate distances are enough). This compute-heavy part is kept CPU-efficient to complement the I/O-efficient index structure.

In summary, the search algorithm provides fast ANN results, honoring transaction visibility rules and any additional filters. By decoupling filter logic (into `allowed_ids`) and using an enhanced traversal strategy, it maintains high recall even for queries that only consider a subset of the data.

## Insertions, Deletions, and Merges: Dynamic Index Operations

**Insertion Workflow:** When a new row is inserted into the base table and indexed (either via an explicit `CREATE INDEX` on existing data or an INSERT statement on a table with an existing index), the extension performs the following steps:

1. **NodeID Allocation:** It obtains the next available `node_id` (from metadata’s counter). Let’s say node_id = N (the current node count before insert). Space for this node will eventually be at offset `N * BLOCK_SIZE` in `graph.lmd` (or in a free slot if available).
2. **NodeBlock Creation:** It constructs a new NodeBlock in memory for this vector. The `row_id` is set to the inserting tuple’s id. The vector data is stored, and initially the neighbor list is empty (or filled after step 3). The header is filled with `origin_txn_id` = current transaction, `commit_epoch` = 0 (not committed yet), `node_version = 1`, `tombstone = false`. This NodeBlock is placed into the LRU cache and marked **dirty** (since it’s new/unsaved).
3. **Neighbor Selection:** The extension finds neighbors for the new node by **graph search**. It performs a partial ANN search in the current index for the new vector to find its approximate nearest neighbors (this is often done by a simplified search with a small L, or even a deterministic search like 1) entry point, 2) greedy descent). Those found neighbors become the new node’s neighbor list. At the same time, the new node will be added as a neighbor to some of those existing nodes. Typically, we take the *R closest existing nodes* as neighbors of the new node, and for each of those, possibly insert the new node into their neighbor list if space or criteria allow. This uses a **“mutual link”** strategy: ensure the graph remains bidirectionally connected. In practice, a routine like `FindAndConnectNeighbors(new_node)` does:
   - For each neighbor chosen for new_node, load that neighbor’s NodeBlock (via `ReadNodeBlock`, which checks cache/shadow/file).
   - If the neighbor’s block has room or a worse neighbor to evict, insert `new_node_id` into its neighbor list (and maybe remove the farthest neighbor to keep list length ≤ R).
   - Mark those neighbor blocks as dirty (copy-on-write updated).
4. **Buffering Changes:** The new NodeBlock and any modified neighbor NodeBlocks are now dirty in the cache. We create `DirtyBlockEntry` records for each and push to the ring buffer. Each entry carries the block pointer, its node_id, origin_txn_id, etc. Multiple entries may share the same origin_txn (the current insertion transaction) – they will all be flushed together after commit.
5. **Update Mapping and Metadata:** Within the inserting transaction, we insert into `lmd_lookup(row_id, node_id)` and update `index_metadata.num_nodes` (+1) and perhaps `index_metadata.max_node_id` = N (if we track separate counts). These go through DuckDB’s transaction and are not visible to others until commit. The `num_nodes` and free list, etc., remain logically consistent (the new node is counted as added, but it’s only fully usable after commit).
6. **Commit-time Flush:** When the user commits the transaction, DuckDB invokes our index’s commit hook. We then finalize and flush. The flush daemon (or the commit thread itself) will assign a `commit_epoch` to the new NodeBlock (typically the current global commit sequence number from DuckDB) and to each neighbor block updated. It then writes all these blocks to `__lmd_blocks` using `INSERT OR REPLACE` (if those neighbor blocks already had an entry in __lmd_blocks from earlier updates, this replaces them with the newest version). This happens very quickly as an atomic batch. Now the new node (and updated neighbors) are durably in the shadow table. The commit can complete. Any concurrent transactions will either see none of these changes (if their snapshot is older) or all of them (if they start after commit, they will see the updated mapping and find the new blocks in shadow table on search).
7. **Post-Commit:** The new node is now part of the graph for future searches. If the inserting transaction continues with more operations (or if autocommit was used, it ends), either way the data is on disk. The actual `graph.lmd` file still doesn’t have this node; it lives in the delta. The system will schedule a merge at a later time to flush it into the main file (especially if many inserts accumulate).

**Deletion Workflow:** When a row is deleted from the base table (or the user issues `DELETE` and it affects an indexed row):

1. The extension intercepts the delete (DuckDB calls the index’s `Delete` method with the row_id).
2. It looks up the corresponding node_id in `lmd_lookup`. Suppose it finds node_id = X.
3. It inserts an entry into `tombstoned_nodes(node_id, deletion_epoch)` for X, with deletion_epoch = current transaction’s commit mark (or 0 until commit). It also removes the `lmd_lookup` entry for that row_id. Both actions happen in the user’s transaction (ensuring atomicity – if rolled back, the mapping stays and tombstone won’t be permanent).
4. It then loads node X’s NodeBlock (from cache/shadow/file). Marks it as `tombstone=true` in the header and updates its `origin_txn_id` to current txn and bumps `node_version`. Its neighbor list could optionally be cleared, but we often leave it – the tombstone flag is enough to signify “ignore this node”. This modified block is put in cache (if not already) and marked dirty.
5. For each neighbor *Y* in X’s neighbor list, we load Y’s NodeBlock and remove X from Y’s neighbor list (copy-on-write update). Mark those neighbors dirty as well. This ensures we proactively unlink the deleted node from the graph, maintaining connectivity among the remaining nodes.
6. All these dirty blocks (X and its affected neighbors) are queued in the ring buffer with origin_txn = current txn.
7. On commit of the delete transaction, a commit_epoch is assigned. The flush writes out all these blocks to `__lmd_blocks`:
   - The deleted node X gets a new entry (or update) in shadow with tombstone=true and commit_epoch = deletion commit.
   - Each neighbor Y gets its updated block (with X removed) written to shadow.
   - The metadata in `index_metadata` updates the node count (we may decrement a live count or keep it for informational purposes) and possibly logs that node X’s slot is free (free list head update).
8. After commit, any new transactions will see that row_id is gone (base table), and the index will either skip node X (via tombstone flag or tombstone table check) in searches. The node still physically exists either in `graph.lmd` (old version) or in shadow (tombstone version), but it’s logically gone.
9. The merge process will later permanently remove X. When merging, if it encounters a tombstoned node in `__lmd_blocks`, it knows not to carry it over to `graph.lmd` (other than maybe writing an updated block with tombstone for completeness). It will add X’s slot to free list and not include X in the merged output. So X’s block eventually won’t appear in `graph.lmd` (and if it does temporarily, it’s marked deleted and won’t be in the index after a vacuum).

This eager neighbor update on delete ensures the graph doesn’t retain stale links. It does incur more I/O per deletion (updating neighbors), but deletions are assumed to be less frequent. If deletion rate were high, a batch strategy could be used (collect deletes and update neighbors in one pass).

**Merge (Compaction) Process:** Inserts and deletes accumulate changes in `__lmd_blocks`. To prevent the delta from growing indefinitely (and to make searches faster by eventually moving everything into the base file), a background *merge* is run. This can be triggered by a threshold (e.g., if the shadow table exceeds X MB or Y% of nodes are dirty) or via an explicit user call (e.g., `VACUUM INDEX myindex`).

The merge process works as follows:

1. It obtains an exclusive lock on the index (to prevent concurrent flush or user writes during the merge window).
2. It scans the `__lmd_blocks` table for all entries (or a chunk of them if doing partial merge). Usually we merge everything to simplify logic.
3. For each entry (block_id = i, blob data, etc.), it writes that blob to the `graph.lmd` file at the appropriate offset (i * BLOCK_SIZE). This overwrites old data or extends the file if i is new (i = current max).
4. It writes in increasing order of block_id to optimize disk access (sequential writes as much as possible).
5. After writing all blocks, it invokes `fsync()` on the `graph.lmd` file to ensure the data is physically on disk.
6. Only after the fsync succeeds, it begins a DuckDB transaction on `diskann_store.duckdb` to remove those entries from `__lmd_blocks` and update metadata:
   - Delete all merged rows from `__lmd_blocks` (where block_id in the merged set).
   - Update `index_metadata.merge_sequence_number += 1`, update `index_metadata.num_nodes` (if new nodes added or removed), update free list head/tail if tombstones were processed.
   - Commit this transaction.
7. Release the index lock.

This two-phase approach (write file, then commit metadata) ensures crash safety:

- If a crash happens *after* file write but *before* deleting from `__lmd_blocks`, on recovery the `__lmd_blocks` still contains those blocks. The index sees that and can either re-merge them (writing the same bytes again, which is harmless) or just consider them not merged. Essentially the merge didn’t “commit.” The next merge will retry. Because we wrote identical data to the same positions, redoing it has no negative effect.
- If a crash happens *after* removing from `__lmd_blocks` but *before* fully writing the file (but we fsync after writing all, so this window is small), we’d detect an inconsistency (metadata says merged, but maybe data missing). However, because we fsync and then transaction commit, the likely crash scenario is the first: partial metadata commit not done.
- If crash happens during file write (before fsync), since we hadn’t committed metadata, on recovery the shadow entries are still there, and the partially written blocks in `graph.lmd` can be detected via checksum mismatch. We can simply overwrite them again.

Thus, merge is **idempotent** and can be safely re-run after a crash. The use of a `merge_sequence_number` in metadata helps verify on startup whether a merge was fully applied. If `__lmd_blocks` is empty but the sequence number is one less than expected, we know the merge cleared it – implying data should be in `graph.lmd`. Minor discrepancy can be resolved by trust in either metadata or perhaps logging merge events.

**Online Merge and Querying:** The index is usable during merges. Readers always check the shadow table first. During the merge, we momentarily lock each NodeBlock being merged to ensure the flush thread doesn’t write a new version of it concurrently (or we pause flush thread entirely during merge). Queries can still proceed: if they look for a block currently being merged, they might find it either in shadow (until we remove it) or already in base – both represent the same data so it’s fine. By doing removal and file update atomically from the perspective of outside transactions, we guarantee a query either sees the old state (with the delta) or the new state (after merge), never an in-between inconsistent state. The design ensures minimal downtime – effectively, merges are *online*. A short X-lock might be taken to swap pointers or flush caches, but not for long durations on the whole index.

**Graph Quality Maintenance:** Over many inserts, the graph structure might degrade (neighbors become suboptimal). The design allows periodic maintenance: we can run an “optimize” that takes nodes and recomputes their neighbors (using more thorough search or brute-force for local region), then treat those as updates (put new neighbor lists into shadow and merge). This incremental rebuild avoids needing a full rebuild from scratch. In practice, after a bulk of insertions, a background task might choose some nodes (e.g., ones with high degree or old ones) and re-evaluate their nearest neighbors from scratch, then update them. The index remains usable throughout, and the shadow merge mechanism handles the updates. Thus, even major graph rewirings can be applied as just “more updates” transactionally.

**Summary of Phases:** In steady state:

- **Insert** adds new NodeBlocks and neighbor tweaks to shadow.
- **Delete** adds tombstones and neighbor removals to shadow.
- **Flush (continuous)** writes those to durable storage quickly.
- **Search** reads from cache → shadow → base, skipping tombstones and uncommitted.
- **Merge (periodic)** consolidates changes to base, freeing shadow and reclaiming space.
- **Vacuum** (explicit or implicit) triggers merges and extreme space reclaim (like tail trimming).
- **Rebuild/Recovery** (if needed) can regenerate mapping or even entire graph from base data if something goes wrong, but normally not needed due to robustness.

## Integration with DuckDB: Planner, Optimizer, and Transactions

From the user’s perspective, the LM-DiskANN index behaves like a native index in DuckDB. The typical usage is:

```sql
-- Create an index on the vector column using LM_DiskANN
CREATE INDEX myindex ON table_name USING LM_DiskANN(vector_column) 
WITH (dimensions=128, block_size=8192, distance_metric='Cosine', R=64, index_location =   'path/to/myindex_data_folder', 
);
```

This statement causes DuckDB to call into the extension’s index creation routine. The index’s parameters (vector dimensions, block size, etc.) are passed in via the `WITH` clause and parsed by our extension. The extension then reads all existing vectors from `table_name.vector_column` and builds the initial graph index (in memory or semi-streaming) before writing out `graph.lmd` and populating the `diskann_store.duckdb` tables. This initial build can use a well-known graph construction algorithm (e.g., incremental insertion using random start or a multi-threaded approach). Once built, the index is persisted and ready for queries.

The extension registers itself as a new **Index type** in DuckDB’s internal catalog. We implement DuckDB’s `Index` interface (or `BoundIndex` subclass). This integration has several facets:

- **Plan Insertion/Deletion Hooks:** DuckDB will call `index->Insert` when a new tuple is appended to the table (in an INSERT or COPY operation). Our `Insert` method executes the workflow described earlier. Similarly, on tuple deletion or update (if the indexed column is updated), corresponding calls are made to remove or update index entries. These hooks ensure the index stays in sync with base table modifications. They execute within the user transaction, so we can piggyback on the transaction to update mapping and mark NodeBlocks, deferring heavy work to background.

- **Index Scans in Queries:** When a query has a predicate that can use the index, the optimizer will create a plan node for an **Index Scan**. For example, a query like:

  ```sql
  SELECT id, data 
  FROM table_name 
  WHERE vector_column <-> [0.2, 0.1, ...] < 0.5 
  USING INDEX myindex;
  ```

  indicates a radius search (distance < 0.5) using the `myindex` index on `vector_column`. DuckDB’s binder/optimizer recognizes the `USING INDEX` hint and the `<->` operator (which we define as a vector distance comparison) and binds it to our index. It will pass the query vector (the constant `[...]`) to the index as a parameter, as well as the distance threshold 0.5.

  Our extension provides an implementation of `IndexScan` that takes these parameters and performs the search. Essentially, it calls something like `DiskANNIndex::Scan(query_vector, K or radius, allowed_ids)` and returns a list of qualifying row_ids (or directly produces tuples via an iterator interface). Under the hood, it uses the search algorithm described above. The results flow into the query execution as if they came from a sequential scan with a filter, but much faster.

- **Cost Model and Optimizer Decisions:** We implement a method to estimate the cost of using the index for a given query (e.g., `myindex->EstimateCost(query)`), considering factors like the proportion of data filtered. For instance, if a query vector has no additional filters (`allowed_ids` is essentially “all”), the cost is roughly proportional to `L_search` (nodes visited) and I/O of reading those nodes. If a highly selective filter is present, the cost might be higher (the dual-heap search may need to scan more nodes to get results). We incorporate a simple formula as a *cost model*, possibly: `cost = C0 + C1 * L_search + C2 * (|allowed_ids|/N) * L_search` (this is an example). The optimizer uses this to compare against other plans (like a full table scan + filter or another index). If our index is estimated to be faster, it will use it. We also allow explicit forcing via `USING INDEX` so users can override the cost if needed.

- **Parallelism:** DuckDB may ask if the index scan can be parallelized. In the initial version, we treat the index scan as a single-thread operation (graph search is inherently difficult to parallelize for one query, though you can use multiple entry points or multiple simultaneous greedy searches). For bulk queries (many query vectors), DuckDB could run multiple index scans in parallel threads (each on a different query). For a single query vector, we stick to one thread to avoid complicating reproducibility and because graph search is typically fast enough.

- **Transaction Integration:** We use DuckDB’s transaction APIs to register commit and rollback hooks. For example, we register a commit hook that triggers flush for that transaction’s dirty blocks. On rollback, DuckDB will call our rollback hook, where we simply discard any dirty cache entries for that transaction (they were isolated, possibly kept in a per-txn structure to free). We ensure that our internal locks or background threads do not hold any resources that span transactions – everything either goes to disk at commit or is thrown away on abort.

- **Attach/Detach:** When the database opens, we have to reattach the index. DuckDB will call our `Deserialize` method (from the checkpointed catalog information). In `Deserialize`, we open the index directory, open `diskann_store.duckdb`, validate that the metadata matches (dimensions, etc.), maybe open `graph.lmd` (via FileSystem), and initialize our structures. We may perform a quick consistency check: e.g., verify the `merge_sequence_number` and that `__lmd_blocks` is empty (or if not empty, possibly run a merge recovery). This ensures the index is ready to use without requiring a full rebuild. On database shutdown, or if the index is dropped, we close file handles and let DuckDB handle deleting files (drop will delete the directory).

**Example Query Flow:** Suppose a user runs:

```sql
BEGIN;
INSERT INTO table_name VALUES (..., [new_vector]);
SELECT * FROM table_name 
WHERE vector_column <-> [qvector] < 0.5 AND category = 'Sports'
USING INDEX myindex;
COMMIT;
```

Inside the transaction:

- The INSERT calls our `Insert` – new NodeBlock buffered.
- The SELECT is a separate transaction or same? If same transaction and they want to see their own insert, our index can include uncommitted nodes from the same txn (we could allow reading those since it’s the same txn context). This is tricky; often indexes in DuckDB may not support reading uncommitted inserts from the same txn due to snapshot rules. We might enforce that until commit, the new vector isn’t queryable (to keep things simple).
- For the SELECT with filter `category='Sports'`, DuckDB filters base table to get allowed row_ids for Sports (perhaps via another index or a quick scan of a small categorical index). It then calls our index scan with allowed_ids mask.
- Our search runs, skipping any node with commit_epoch > current (there might be none except our uncommitted insert, which we likely skip).
- Returns row_ids of matching neighbors found.
- DuckDB then fetches the actual tuples for those row_ids (either via the index providing them or a separate fetch). Those tuples are output.
- On COMMIT, the new vector is flushed to shadow. Future queries can now retrieve it.

This integration ensures that index usage is as transparent as possible: the query optimizer chooses it when beneficial, and the user can rely on transaction semantics as usual.

## C++20 Modular Implementation and Architecture

The LM-DiskANN extension is implemented in modern C++20, emphasizing modular design, RAII, and clean separation of DuckDB-specific code from the core indexing logic. Here we outline the architecture of the code components and how they interact, following the project’s C++ guidelines.

**Modules and Namespaces:** The code is divided into two main parts:

- `diskann` namespace: the *core index logic* (graph management, search, storage abstraction, etc.), written as C++20 module units.
- `duckdb` namespace (within our extension codebase): the *DuckDB integration layer* (index interface implementation, using DuckDB APIs, etc.), also modular.

We enforce a **unidirectional dependency**: core `diskann` modules do not include or depend on DuckDB headers; they interact through abstract interfaces. The DuckDB-side modules import the core and implement those interfaces with DuckDB specifics. This allows us to test core components in isolation and even reuse them in another context (for example, a standalone tool or different DB) by providing a different integration layer.

**Key Classes and Interfaces:**

- **`diskann::Coordinator`:** The central manager of the index. This class (in module `diskann.Coordinator`) owns the high-level state: pointers to other managers, index configuration, and is the entry point for operations like *Build*, *Search*, *Insert*, *Delete*, *Merge*. It coordinates tasks by delegating to specialized components (similar to a controller/facade). For example, `Coordinator.Insert(vector)` will call into GraphManager to find neighbors, update neighbor links, then call StorageManager to record dirty blocks, etc. The Coordinator is *instantiated by* the DuckDB side when an index is opened.
- **`duckdb::DiskannIndex`:** This is the class that inherits from DuckDB’s `Index` (or implements the required interface functions like `InitializeLock`, `Insert`, `Delete`, `Scan`, `Serialize`, etc.). It lives in module `duckdb.DiskannIndex`. It contains an instance (or unique_ptr) of `diskann::Coordinator`. Its job is to translate DuckDB calls to Coordinator calls. For instance, when DuckDB wants to insert a tuple, `DiskannIndex::Insert` is invoked; it locks the index (using a mutex from `BoundIndex`), then calls `coordinator.Insert(...)`, and records necessary info. It also sets up commit/rollback hooks through DuckDB’s transaction interface. On creation, it sets up things like `duckdb::DiskannShadowStorageService` and injects that into the Coordinator. The DiskannIndex class is the bridge that knows about both worlds (DuckDB and our core).
- **`diskann::IStorageManager` & `diskann::StorageManager`:** The storage manager encapsulates all low-level I/O to `graph.lmd` and coordination with the shadow store. `IStorageManager` (module `diskann.IStorageManager`) defines an interface with methods like `ReadNodeBlock(node_id)`, `WriteNodeBlock(node_id, data)`, `FlushDirty(block_id, data)`, `MergeAll()`, etc. The concrete `StorageManager` implementation uses DuckDB’s `FileSystem` API (or OS calls) to read/write the graph file and uses the `IShadowStorageService` to interact with `__lmd_blocks`. It manages file handles, ensures writes are synced, and might also implement caching of file handles or batched operations. It obeys RAII: opening file in constructor, closing in destructor, ensuring fsync on destruction if needed. In code, Coordinator uses `StorageManager` to load blocks on cache misses or to trigger merges.
- **`diskann::store::IShadowStorageService`:** This interface (module `diskann.store.IShadowStorageService`) defines how the core can perform operations on the shadow tables without depending on DuckDB directly. It has methods like `InsertBlock(block_id, data, version, commit_epoch, tombstone)`, `GetBlock(block_id)`, `DeleteBlocks(range)`, `QueryTombstone(node_id)`, etc. In the DuckDB layer, we implement this as `duckdb::DiskannShadowStorageService` which uses DuckDB’s C++ API or prepared statements to execute these queries on `diskann_store.duckdb`. For example, it holds prepared `INSERT OR REPLACE` and `SELECT` statements for the `__lmd_blocks` table and executes them on calls. The Coordinator and StorageManager call these interface methods to persist or retrieve delta info. By abstracting it, our core logic just says “shadow_store->InsertBlock(...)", and the DuckDB-specific code takes care of actual database interaction.
- **`diskann::GraphManager`:** Handles graph topology operations. It might implement functions like `AddNode(node_id, vector)`, `RemoveNode(node_id)`, `FindNeighbors(vector) -> list of node_ids`, `ConnectNeighbor(node_id, neighbor_id)`. The GraphManager knows the graph navigation logic, possibly keeping some transient structures (like an entry point or a simple index for performing initial neighbor search). It might also implement the *robust prune* algorithm for adjusting neighbor lists. In our architecture, GraphManager will use the Searcher (for finding neighbors for a new node) and then instruct StorageManager to mark nodes as dirty when links change. It ensures any graph invariants (like max degree) are maintained when updating neighbors.
- **`diskann::Searcher`:** Focused on query-time operations. It implements the actual search algorithm (greedy graph traversal with dual heaps). It provides methods like `Search(query_vector, K, allowed_ids_set) -> vector<node_id>`. It interacts with StorageManager (to load NodeBlocks) and with distance computation utilities. The Searcher likely uses a reference to the Coordinator or StorageManager to fetch NodeBlocks (which under the hood goes through cache -> shadow -> file). It does not worry about transactions; it assumes the snapshot’s view is handled by the data it receives (i.e., StorageManager’s ReadNodeBlock will give it only visible versions). The Searcher is heavily read-only and can be used concurrently by multiple threads on the same index (since it doesn’t modify state, apart from maybe some counters).
- **Distance and Compression Utilities:** In `diskann.distance` module, we implement static functions or functors for computing distances (cosine, inner product, etc.), possibly with C++20 concepts to ensure they accept proper iterator types. In `diskann.ternary_quantization` or similar module, we implement functions to compress a float vector to ternary and to compute approximate distances efficiently. These modules are stateless and purely functional, making them easy to test and reuse.
- **Shared Types:** A `diskann.types` module defines common data structures like the layout of NodeBlock in C++ (perhaps a struct for the header, but careful: NodeBlock is not a simple struct due to variable-length neighbors). We might represent NodeBlock in memory as a struct with flexible array member or just manage it via accessor methods since it’s fixed-size binary. Other types include config struct, error codes, etc. Constants (like magic numbers, default R, etc.) go in `diskann.constants`.

**Memory Management and Safety:** We utilize RAII throughout. For example:

- File handles are wrapped in DuckDB’s `FileHandle` (which closes on destruction), or a smart-pointer managing OS file descriptor.
- The background flush thread is managed by a std::thread within Coordinator or StorageManager; it’s started on index opening and joined on index close (ensuring no detached threads).
- The LRU cache entries use `std::shared_ptr<NodeBlock>` so that if the flush thread is writing a block while the main thread evicts it, the data isn’t freed until flush finishes. We use `std::unique_ptr` for single-ownership (e.g., Coordinator owns GraphManager as unique, because there’s one graph manager).
- We avoid raw `new`/`delete`; dynamic allocations are in smart pointers or standard containers. This prevents leaks and makes ownership clear (e.g., Coordinator has unique_ptr to StorageManager and GraphManager – when Coordinator is destroyed, those are automatically destroyed, closing files and joining threads).
- We mark methods `const` wherever applicable (e.g., distance compute functions, certain getters) to enforce that they don’t modify state. This aids in reasoning about thread safety (const methods can be called without locks if they truly don’t modify shared state).

**Concurrency and Locks:** DuckDB’s `IndexLock` (in `BoundIndex`) provides a high-level mutex that serializes index operations at the table level. We use this for simplicity in initial versions: every insert/delete/search holds the lock for the duration. This guarantees correctness but can limit concurrency. Because we want to allow simultaneous searches even while merges or flushes happen, we introduced finer-grained locks:

- Each NodeBlock in cache may have its own `mutex` for neighbor list modifications. Inserts acquiring locks on a set of nodes (the new node and its neighbors) can proceed in parallel with other inserts that touch different nodes (we avoid two inserts updating the same neighbor concurrently by locking that neighbor).
- A global `flush_mutex` or condition is used so that flush thread can run concurrently with searches but not concurrently with an ongoing merge (we might use a read-write lock: multiple readers (searches) can proceed, but merge takes a write lock).
- We define a lock ordering to prevent deadlocks (e.g., always lock smaller node_id first). For neighbor updates, since we choose neighbors by distance, we can lock the new node, then each neighbor in increasing id order.
- The extension initialization (when attaching multiple indexes at once) uses a global init mutex to avoid two indexes trying to create their directories or threads simultaneously in interfering ways.

We will refine concurrency in MVP stages (initially relying on coarse locks, then introducing more parallelism as needed). The design allows substituting the coarse `IndexLock`: for example, Searcher can run without holding the global lock if we ensure underlying structures (like reading NodeBlocks) use atomic snapshot data. By separating flush vs search (which operate on separate data structures: flush writes to DB, search reads mostly immutable data), we can minimize blocking.

**Exception and Error Handling:** In this C++ extension, we adopt DuckDB’s approach: throw exceptions for critical errors (DuckDB will catch and report as query errors). For recoverable or expected conditions, use `std::optional` or `std::expected` (from C++23 or an equivalent) to return results or error codes. For example, `ReadNodeBlock(node_id)` might return `optional<NodeBlock>` – empty if not found (which shouldn’t happen unless corruption). On corruption detection (checksum mismatch), we might throw an exception indicating index corruption, which could abort the query or even mark the index broken (requiring rebuild). We also define custom exception types or error enums for clarity (e.g., `DiskANNException` or error codes for “file not found”, “unsupported configuration”). All resources use RAII, so even if an exception is thrown, destructors will clean up (no leaks of file handles or locks).

**Documentation and Maintainability:** Every public class and function is documented with Doxygen-style comments (/** … */) explaining its purpose, parameters, and invariants. This is particularly important at the interface boundaries: e.g., `IShadowStorageService` methods explain that they must be transaction-safe and what errors they might throw. The modular structure with explicit exports makes it clear what functions are accessible to other components. Non-exported functions are internal, truly hidden from other translation units, which enforces encapsulation and allows changing implementations without affecting other modules. The code uses descriptive names (e.g., `InsertNode`, `PerformSearch`, `FlushDaemonLoop`) to be self-documenting. We avoid overly template-heavy designs to keep compile times reasonable, but use C++20 features like ranges or concepts where they simplify code (for instance, a concept for “DistanceComputable” could ensure any distance functor has a certain signature).

**Testing:** Because the core logic is separated from DuckDB, we can instantiate `diskann::Coordinator` in a standalone test harness, providing a dummy `IShadowStorageService` (that might just store to a map in memory) and a dummy filesystem (storing blocks in an array or a temp file). This way, we can unit test graph building, search correctness, merges, etc., without running a full DB. Then we also test the integration layer within DuckDB by running SQL queries and ensuring results match (these would be higher-level integration tests). The architecture’s decoupling maximizes test coverage and eases debugging.

The final code structure might look like this (simplified):

This modular breakdown ensures that changes in, say, how we compress vectors (in `ternary_quantization.cppm`) do not affect how we interact with DuckDB (in `DiskannIndex.cppm`). If DuckDB’s index interface changes, we likely only need to adjust `duckdb::DiskannIndex` and perhaps the shadow service.

Finally, the extension adheres to modern best practices: **smart pointers for ownership** (unique_ptr for exclusive, shared_ptr only when necessary for shared cache entries), **std::span** for array parameters (e.g., passing around vector data without copying), **const-correctness** to prevent unintended modifications, and **clean interface/implementation separation** for maintainability. This modular architecture not only yields clean code but also offers potential for reusability – for instance, the `diskann` core could be packaged as a library used by other applications (with a different `IShadowStorageService` to, say, log to a file instead of DuckDB). It also simplifies testing, as we can mock storage or inject faults to test recovery logic.

## Implementation Roadmap: Phased Development of Features

The project was executed in iterative MVP stages, each adding functionality and complexity gradually. This phased approach ensured that core principles were validated early and that subsequent features (e.g., filtering, concurrency) built on a solid base.

**MVP 0 – Static Index Build and Basic Query:** *Goal:* Create a read-only index with all data in `graph.lmd` and basic search, no dynamic updates yet. In this stage, we implemented:

- The ability to bulk load vectors and build the graph (possibly using a simple single-thread insertion or an existing algorithm).
- Writing the initial `graph.lmd` file with all NodeBlocks, and populating `lmd_lookup` and `index_metadata` in `diskann_store.duckdb`.
- A rudimentary `ReadNodeBlock` that reads directly from `graph.lmd` by offset (no shadow table, since no updates yet).
- A `PerformSearch` that uses a single max-heap (no dual heaps since no filters yet) to do greedy search, ignoring MVCC (all data is committed).
- The DuckDB integration to allow `SELECT ... USING INDEX myindex` to call our search.
- Basic `Serialize/Deserialize` of the index metadata (store path, config) so the index persists across DB restarts.
- In this MVP, we did **not** include `__lmd_blocks` or `tombstoned_nodes` tables at all. The index was effectively static after creation.

This MVP confirmed that the graph search works correctly within DuckDB and established the baseline code structure (Coordinator, etc.). It allowed read performance testing on static data.

**MVP 1 – Insertions and Shadow Write Path:** *Goal:* Support inserting new vectors transactionally, using the shadow delta mechanism for durability without merging. Key features added:

- **LRU Cache:** Implemented a thread-safe LRU cache of NodeBlocks to hold new and frequently accessed blocks. Verified that we can mark entries dirty and manage their lifetime.
- **Dirty Ring Buffer and Flush Daemon:** Created the in-memory queue for dirty blocks and a background flush thread to write to `__lmd_blocks` table asynchronously. Initially, we simplified commit handling: we might assume immediate commit for testing, then later integrate proper txn checks.
- **Shadow Table Schema and I/O:** Set up the `__lmd_blocks` table in `diskann_store.duckdb` (with `block_id, data, version, checksum`, etc.). Implemented `IndexStoreManager` (or ShadowStorageService) functions to `INSERT OR REPLACE` entries in this table and to fetch a block by id. This gave us the O(1) lookup for latest block version.
- **Enhanced Read Logic:** Modified `ReadNodeBlock` to first look in cache, then query `__lmd_blocks`, then fall back to `graph.lmd`. This guarantees a search will see the latest inserted nodes (from shadow) even before merge.
- **Basic MVCC Handling:** Began honoring `commit_epoch` in NodeBlocks. In MVP 1, we might not have had the real DuckDB epoch, so we used a simple global counter or timestamp to tag blocks and compared that to a “query epoch” (which could be current time or an approximation). This was a placeholder to ensure the concept works. Proper integration with DuckDB’s TransactionManager came later.
- **Insert Operation:** Enabled `Insert`: computing neighbors for the new node (using search), updating neighbor blocks, marking all dirty, updating mapping and metadata in the same txn. Flushing these after commit.
- The flush daemon in MVP 1 might, for simplicity, assume every dirty block belongs to a committed txn (we ensured to call flush after commit). We deferred detailed commit status checking to MVP 4, meaning in MVP 1 we could temporarily ignore abort scenarios (we just didn’t flush if not committed, or we had a way to know via a hook).
- Transactional consistency: By updating `lmd_lookup` and `index_metadata` in the user transaction, we ensured atomic mapping. We introduced an `index_version` or `commit_epoch_watermark` in metadata to track last committed epoch, and stored commit_epoch in NodeBlocks.
- At this stage, deletion was not yet supported, and merge was not implemented. Inserts would accumulate in `__lmd_blocks` and searches would always check there.

MVP 1 was tested by inserting vectors and immediately querying them (to verify they appear), and also crash-testing by forcing a crash after commit to see if WAL replay restores the shadow table correctly.

**MVP 2 – Merge, Deletion, and Vacuum:** *Goal:* Complete the lifecycle by implementing the merge/compaction process and supporting deletions (tombstones), plus a basic manual trigger for merge (vacuum).

- **Merge Thread:** Implemented the background merge task that reads the `__lmd_blocks` table and writes blocks to `graph.lmd` in-place. Ensured to fsync and then transactionally clear the table and update metadata (including free list and merge counter).
- **Tombstone Support:** Added the `tombstoned_nodes` table and deletion logic in `Delete`:
  - On delete, add node_id to tombstone table, remove mapping, mark NodeBlock.tombstone and update neighbors to remove links.
  - Flush these as with inserts. We treated a tombstone like a special update.
- **Read Logic V2:** `ReadNodeBlock` now checks if a block is tombstoned (flag or in tombstone table) and if so, treats it as non-existent for active transactions. We also cross-check tombstone table when reading from base file: if a NodeBlock from `graph.lmd` is older and might not have tombstone flag, we consult `tombstoned_nodes` to decide visibility.
- **Search Skip Tombstones:** Updated `PerformSearch` to skip over tombstoned nodes entirely (do not add them to result or exploration).
- **Vacuum Command:** Implemented a `VacuumIndex()` method that the SQL `VACUUM INDEX myindex` calls. This triggers a merge and applies free list cleanup. In MVP 2, the free list handling was introduced:
  - Mark freed slots in metadata when a tombstone is merged (so that slot can be reused).
  - Implement tail truncation: after merge, if the highest node_ids are tombstoned, truncate file.
- Internally, metadata now tracks free list head etc. The merge uses this to decide where to write new blocks (for any new node beyond file end or filling holes).

MVP 2 testing focused on deleting vectors and ensuring they no longer appear in results, that space is reclaimed on vacuum, and that merging does not break existing links. We simulated crashes during merge to verify idempotence (e.g., run merge, kill process, restart, ensure shadow entries are either remerged or still present).

**MVP 3 – Advanced Query Capabilities (Filtering and Cost):** *Goal:* Improve search to handle allowed_ids filtering and integrate with DuckDB’s optimizer via cost model.

- **Dual-Heap Search:** Modified `Searcher.Search` to maintain two heaps (RH and EH) and implemented the strategy to continue exploring via EH even when RH has results, until termination criteria met. This required more complex logic and careful testing to ensure it doesn’t loop infinitely and that it still finds correct neighbors.
- **Allowed IDs Interface:** We designed how `allowed_ids` are passed in. For MVP 3, we assumed a simple interface for testing: e.g., provide a vector of allowed node_ids. In integration, we refined it to a bitset or DuckDB selection vector. We implemented membership checks in the inner loop efficiently (e.g., binary search or direct boolean array lookup).
- **Configurable `L_search`:** Made the beam width a parameter (possibly accessible via `SET` or PRAGMA). The extension can read a DuckDB session variable or use a member of IndexConfig for `L_search`. We also added a warning if search terminates with incomplete results due to filter (as per design).
- **Cost Model:** Implemented `ConstructCost` or similar in `DiskannIndex`. For now, we might use a simplistic formula or even a constant cost if K is small vs table size (since no selectivity info yet). But we did incorporate an extra cost if `allowed_ids` is present (since filtered search may need larger L). In the future this can be refined with actual stats (e.g., if filter selects 1% of data, maybe increase cost).
- **Optimizer Rules:** We added in the extension’s `ExtensionEntry` a rule or configuration so that the planner knows that for an expression like `vector_column <-> [query] < r`, our index can be used. Possibly we register a function or operator `<->` that the optimizer can map to an index range scan. This part may involve DuckDB’s extension API for optimizer bindings.

MVP 3 was validated by running queries with filters (e.g., find nearest neighbors of X among category=Sports) and comparing results with brute force (to ensure recall is acceptable). We also checked that if we restrict allowed_ids to a tiny set, the index search still finds them (or all if within radius). The cost model’s effect was observed by running queries with and without `USING INDEX` hint to see if the optimizer chooses the index appropriately.

**MVP 4 – Full Transactional Robustness and Hardening:** *Goal:* Finalize all edge cases, performance tweaks, and ensure production stability.

- **Full MVCC Integration:** At this stage, we replaced any provisional epoch logic with actual hooks into DuckDB’s `TransactionManager`. On each commit, we obtain the actual commit id/epoch from DuckDB and use it for NodeBlocks (DuckDB likely uses a global epoch or the transaction’s start time + some global counter). We also use DuckDB’s provided *snapshot number* for the current transaction when doing visibility checks, rather than our own counter.
- **Commit/Abort Hooks:** We ensure the flush daemon double-checks that `origin_txn_id` is committed by asking DuckDB (maybe via `TransactionManager::CheckCommitted(txn_id)`). Aborted transactions’ entries in the ring buffer are dropped and their dirty cache entries freed. We free per-txn allocations on rollback to avoid memory leaks of uncommitted data.
- **Concurrency Tuning:** We benchmark the index under concurrent load (multiple clients inserting and querying). If the `IndexLock` is a bottleneck, we consider unlocking search operations to allow parallel searches. We possibly introduce sharded locks (e.g., 16 locks for NodeBlocks by id mod 16) to allow parallel inserts that target different areas. We documented the locking strategy clearly so future devs can further refine if needed.
- **Recovery and Validation:** We hardened startup logic. `Deserialize` now performs checks:
  - Compare the last merge number in `index_metadata` vs a value stored in DuckDB’s main metadata for the index. If mismatch, perhaps issue a warning or automatically run a merge recovery.
  - Verify that `num_nodes` in metadata matches the size of `lmd_lookup` etc. If any inconsistency is found (could be due to a crash after partially applied changes), we choose a safe resolution: e.g., if `__lmd_blocks` has entries but merge_sequence is equal – meaning a crash in the middle – we rerun merge or roll back those blocks.
  - If something unrecoverable is found (corruption in file, checksum mismatch on a random sample of NodeBlocks), we mark the index “needs rebuild.” This could be done by throwing an exception on attachment, which DuckDB can catch and disable the index, or by setting an internal flag. The user can then drop and recreate the index. Our aim is to never return wrong results silently.
- **Observability:** We added internal counters and perhaps `PRAGMA` commands to retrieve them. E.g., `PRAGMA diskann_stats('myindex')` might output: number of NodeBlocks in cache, cache hit rate, last merge time and duration, number of blocks in shadow, etc. We instrumented the search to count nodes visited, distance computations, etc., and perhaps log or store these in a debug global that can be queried. This helps in performance tuning and ensuring the algorithm behaves as expected (for instance, monitoring how large EH vs RH get in filtered searches, to adjust default `L_search` or the penalty factor).
- **Cleanup and Docs:** We removed any leftover simplifications (like the assumption in MVP1 flush that all txns commit) and ensured every code path is solid. Updated documentation to reflect the final design. Ensured all threads join on exit and all file handles close to not leak resources across queries or on DB shutdown.

After MVP 4, the extension was considered production-ready: it handles inserts, deletes, merges smoothly, integrates fully with DuckDB transactions and query planner, and has been tested under various scenarios (bulk load, high concurrency, crash recovery). Key edge cases like highly selective filters, many deletes followed by merges, and memory stress have been tried to verify the system’s robustness.

## Edge Cases, Concurrency Considerations, and Future Work

While the design addresses the major challenges of durability, staleness, and performance, a few edge cases and advanced scenarios merit discussion:

- **High-Concurrency Workloads:** In workloads with many simultaneous insertions and searches, contention may occur on internal resources. We mitigate this with fine-grained locks (per NodeBlock) and by making search mostly lock-free (only read locks if at all). There is a potential for deadlocks if two inserts try to update each other’s neighbor lists; our lock ordering by node_id prevents this by always locking in a consistent global order. We also considered using try-lock with retries if out-of-order lock needed, but found a strict order suffices. The background flush and merge threads run with low priority and acquire locks carefully: flush locks one block at a time (so it never holds multiple NodeBlock locks concurrently), and merge acquires a global lock but only after quiescing flush. This ensures no cyclic dependency (flush might wait for merge to finish; merge won’t wait on flush since flush is paused or finished). Attaching multiple indexes concurrently (in separate threads) could have caused meta-level deadlocks; we avoid that by a global initialization mutex so they attach one by one.
- **Persistent Storage Edge Cases:** The `diskann_store.duckdb` is subject to the same durability as DuckDB. However, if it gets corrupted or out of sync while `graph.lmd` is intact (or vice versa), recovery steps are available. For example, if the store DB is lost but `graph.lmd` remains, we can rebuild it by scanning `graph.lmd` and re-deriving `lmd_lookup` (since each block has row_id) and metadata (count nodes, perhaps recompute neighbor degrees if needed). Conversely, if `graph.lmd` is lost but the store remains (mapping and metadata intact), we can theoretically reinsert all vectors from base table: since we have `lmd_lookup` giving which row_ids were indexed, we fetch those vectors and rebuild. These are heavy operations, but possible last resorts. In practice, such corruption is rare due to WAL and careful writes. The design intentionally keeps `graph.lmd` relatively simple (sequence of fixed blocks) to minimize corruption surface – each block has a checksum, so we can detect any bitrot or torn write on a single block and potentially fix or rebuild just that node (e.g., re-index that vector from base table if available).
- **Compaction Heuristics:** When to merge is a tunable decision. We have a threshold on the size of `__lmd_blocks` or the ratio of dirty blocks. The ideal frequency might depend on workload: heavy insert streams might postpone merge to batch many inserts (amortizing expensive file syncs), whereas occasional inserts can merge eagerly. We allow manual control via `VACUUM INDEX` for immediate consolidation. In the future, an adaptive heuristic could monitor the query performance (if searches slow down because the shadow table got large, that indicates merge would help) or the system I/O load (merging when disk is idle). The merge process itself could also be made incremental – e.g., merge 1000 nodes at a time to avoid large latency spikes. Our MVP 2 implementation does a full merge in one go, but it can be tuned for huge indexes (merging millions of entries in smaller batches to not stall other operations).
- **Memory Pressure Management:** The extension’s memory use comes mainly from the cache and any structures for allowed_ids. If the system is low on RAM, we could downsize the cache dynamically or even spill parts of allowed_ids (though allowed_ids typically comes from a bitset of base table which itself might be large). The default is that the cache is bounded and should not exceed a configured fraction of memory (ensuring other queries have room). We also considered integration with DuckDB’s memory profiler – possibly registering our cache with it so that if DuckDB needs memory, we could be signaled to free some cache pages. This is a potential future enhancement: at the moment, the cache is independent.
- **Search Result Accuracy under Filtering:** While our dual-heap algorithm significantly improves recall for filtered searches, extremely selective filters (e.g., allowed_ids is 0.001% of nodes) could still pose challenges. If the allowed nodes are very scattered, one might need a very large `L_search` to find one. We added the warning system to alert when results might be missing. In a future version, we could implement a fallback: if after using the index the results are fewer than K, we could do a brute-force scan of the allowed_ids set to find the remaining nearest neighbors exactly. Since allowed_ids could be large, this is only feasible if it’s small or if accuracy is paramount. Another approach is to incorporate some *filter awareness* in the graph – e.g., maintain a secondary entry point or subgraph per category. The current design keeps the index oblivious to filters, which simplifies updates.
- **Large Deletes and Rebuild:** If a user deletes a huge fraction of the vectors, the graph could become fragmented or less efficient (many tombstones until vacuum). The free list ensures space is reused for future inserts, but if no inserts come, you might end up with a lot of tombstoned nodes taking up room until a merge/vacuum is run. We recommend running `VACUUM INDEX` after bulk deletions to reclaim space and remove tombstones from neighbor lists for cleanliness. In worst-case scenarios (e.g., 90% of nodes deleted), a full rebuild from scratch might be simpler than processing massive updates. The architecture allows that: one can drop and recreate the index, or even have a background thread that if tombstones exceed some threshold, triggers a more aggressive rebuild where it loads remaining vectors and rebuilds the graph fresh.
- **Parallel Build and Scalability:** The current implementation builds the graph using a single thread inserting one vector at a time (perhaps with a simple heuristic). For very large datasets (100M+ vectors), a more efficient build is needed. In future work, we plan to integrate a parallel graph construction (such as the *prefix-doubling* algorithm suggested in DiskANN, or building in multiple shards and linking them). The code is structured so that `Coordinator::BuildIndex()` could spawn multiple threads (using DuckDB’s `TaskScheduler`) that each build part of the graph. Since the graph file is append-only during build, threads could work on different segments. This wasn’t in initial MVPs but is a logical extension to improve initial index creation time.
- **Dependency Direction Finalized:** By the end, we confirmed the **dependency flow**: `duckdb::DiskannIndex` depends on `diskann::Coordinator` and not vice versa. The `diskann` core calls DuckDB services only through interfaces (like `IShadowStorageService`). This one-way dependence makes the core portable and the DuckDB layer thin. This was a deliberate design principle to avoid entangling core logic with DB-specific details, which has paid off in easier debugging and potential reuse.
- **Metrics and Monitoring:** We have built-in counters for flush and merge frequency, cache hits, etc., which could be exposed via DuckDB’s `PRAGMA` or status functions. An idea is to integrate with DuckDB’s `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` so that if an index scan is used, it can report metrics like “DiskANN index search visited X nodes, did Y I/Os, distance calculations Z”. This would help tune parameters (for example, seeing that for certain queries, the search visits near the max `L_search` might prompt increasing it for better recall).
- **Future Extensions:** Beyond parallel build, other future extensions could include:
  - **Hierarchical Graph (HNSW-like layers):** For even faster search on very large data, a layer of summary nodes (entry points) could reduce search cost. We’ve not implemented this yet, sticking to DiskANN’s single-layer graph.
  - **Vector Updates:** Updating a vector’s value (not just insertion/deletion) currently is treated as a delete+insert of that node. We could optimize the case where a vector’s position moves slightly by adjusting neighbors rather than full reinsertion. But frequency of that is typically low.
  - **Support for Multiple Vector Columns:** The design currently indexes one vector column. DuckDB could allow multi-column indexes; our extension could be extended to index combined vectors or support multiple separate indexes per table.
  - **Integration with DuckDB Buffer Manager:** If DuckDB’s buffer manager evolves to better support custom eviction policies, we might integrate more tightly to let DuckDB manage `graph.lmd` pages. But given we handle caching well, this is low priority.
  - **Cross-Index Joins:** Possibly using the index for join operations (e.g., nearest neighbor join between two tables). This would be complex but theoretically possible, using one index to probe another.

In conclusion, the LM-DiskANN DuckDB extension provides a **comprehensive, modular ANN indexing solution** that takes the research prototype to a fully functional DB index. It handles dynamic workloads with transactional safety, maintains performance via caching and optimized I/O, and integrates smoothly with query planning. Through careful design (shadow tables, copy-on-write, MVCC) and iterative refinements (mitigating durability and recall issues), we achieved an index that can scale to billions of vectors on disk while working harmoniously inside DuckDB. This document serves both as a reference of the final architecture and a guide for future maintenance and enhancements by C++ engineers working on the project. The dependency separation and adherence to modern C++ practices ensure the codebase is maintainable and robust as we move forward, extending the capabilities of DuckDB in the vector search domain.
